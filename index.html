<br>
<b>HTML</b><br>
<br>
The web mainly consists of HTML docs
<em>(Hypertext Markup Languge).</em> Here is the web Browsing Proccess:<br>
<br>
User opens web browser > Browser send HTTPS request to server> Server retrieves content (HTML Doc) and forwards back to user
<br>
After the HTML doc is pushed to the user, the browser interprets the file and displays it on-screen.
<br>
<br>

- Text content<br>
- Markup <br>
- References <br>
- Links <br>
<br>
<b>Attributes & Tags</b><br>
<br>
<em>- Attributes</em> are used to assign certain properties to tags. The Anchoring attribute, for example, is used to create links. We can also assign<br>an Image attribute to a tag, by pulling its source.<br>
<br>- <a href = "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444
"><em>Tags</em></a> are used to distinguish each type of element.
Here are examples of some commonly used tags:<br>
<br>
- Bold tags: Create <b>bold</b> text<br>
- Emphasis tags: <em>Italicise</em> text<br>
- Break tags: With this tag, we can specify when to move on to the next line.<br>
<br>
<b>Inline Vs. Block</b><br>
<br>
Although they seem to perform the same function, they are actually quite different. As the name implies, Inline tage are kept in-line (localized).<br>
Blocks are different, as they actually create a sort of "Invisible Box" around the designated HTML element.<br><br>
<b>WhiteSpacing</b><br>
<br>
HTML interprets text on a single line by default. If we want to force multiple lines of text,<br>
we have to use the break tag.<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>Note:</em><br>
Computers will only do as asked. Make sure to adhere to the appropriate syntax. They will not understand spelling mistakes,<br>
so make sure that your code isn't ambiguous
